# WineQuality_LinearRegression

WINE_preprocessing.ipynb is a script to clean up, visualize, and train simple linear regression onto the wine dataset.

WINE_MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb trains a multiple linear regression model to predict the target feature (Quality). I account for multicollinearity using VIF scores and use 5-Fold Cross Validation to validate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model.
